# giphyhomework

This is homework 6 for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp!

The objective of the homework was to practice using APIs and start to generate information on page with one.

The page comes pre-populated with some buttons but the user can also add their own with the search function on the right side of the page.

Once the user sees the button of the thing they are interested they can click it and 10 random GIF from Giphy will appear on the page as well as the GIF's rating.

The user can then click on each GIF to pause and un-pause each one.

Have fun GIF-ing!
